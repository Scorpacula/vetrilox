ONLINE VERSION CONTAINS MORE FEATURES AND COMMANDS THAN THE OPEN SOURCE VERSION. WE RECOMMEND USING THE ONLINE VERSION DUE TO IT BEING MORE ADVANCED AND MORE CAPABLE. THIS VERSION MAY CONTAIN BUGS DUE TO IT BEING AN OLDER VERSION. YOU MAY CREATE AN ISSUE REQUEST BUT BE PREPARED FOR IT TO BE IGNORED.
